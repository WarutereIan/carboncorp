### Description

CarbonCorps enables any person or project to earn the CarbonCorp Token (CC) from the day-to-day Green activities, which are representative of carbon credits. The CarbonCorp Token is then exchangable for USDT on the CarbonSwap DEX for the users to redeem their tokens. 

The tokens are minted to the user's wallet for every amount of carbon offset.

The CC Certificate (CCCT) is designed to be a non-transferrable fungible token, gained when an entity purchases CC from the CarbonSwap. The corresponding amount of CC Tokens are burned in the purchase, representative of the amount of carbon offset.  

CC Tokens are continuously listed on other exchanges to enable the CarbonSwap Liquidity Providers obtain the token.

### Entities

- CarbonCorps (Org)

- Entity offsetting Carbon (e.g Ethereum)

- CC Token Minter and seller (e.g conservation project)
 
- CarbonSwap Dex Liquidity Providers

### Tokens

#### CC Token(CC) 
- mintable as rewards for activity that contributes to offsetting carbon

- 1 CC Token = 1 Metric Tonne of carbon offset
- swappable for USDT (or other token) in the CarbonSwap Dex. This is to enable those rewarded with the token to redeem it for monetary gain
- listed on other DEXes and CEXes for LPs to access it (in limited amounts)
- one of the tokens in the pair provided by Liquidity Providers in CarbonSwap
- burnt when bought at the CarbonSwap Dex, in exchange for an equal amount of the CC Certificate token
#### CC Liquidity Token (CCLT)
- an interest generating token
- issued to liquidity providers in the CarbonSwap Dex
- redeemable for the provided token pair with the configured interest
- will have a vesting term 
 #### CC Certificate Token (CCCT)
- non-transferable token
- minted and issued to buyer of CC only on CarbonSwap Dex to represent their activities in offsetting carbon (Proof of Offset) 

### Financial Model:
- CarbonSwap Fees distributed between Carbon Corps and Liquidity Providers
- Minting ratio of CC Token: 30% to CarbonCorps, 70% to Entity Making Green Initiatives. CarbonSwap is intended to have the best purchase price of CC Token from higher demand than on other DEXes, as offset certificate for the project is only issuable on CarbonSwap. Thus minters will naturally trade more on CarbonSwap.
